## Core reduction and total least squares for matrix approximation problems

  This repository is a supplement to my master thesis of the same name. It includes all the routines used in the numerical analysis section of the thesis.\
The functions are implemented in MATLAB R2024b and each function includes a paragraph with detailed description and instructions. Hence, for more information about each function, please reffer to the corresponding description paragraph.

For more details on the numerical experiments performed, see the thesis (a link will be inserted as soon as the thesis is available online).
