% Generating problems of given TLS classification
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This function generates the model and observation matrices A and B such
% that the problem AX â‰ˆ B is of the specified TLS class. It also outputs
% the right singular matrix V corresponding to the extended matrix [B,A].


%   INPUT parameters
% * m ... number of rows of matrices A and B
% * n ... number of columns of matrix A
% * d ... number of columns of matrix B
% * class ... desired TLS class of the resulting problem
%         = "S", "F1", "F2" or "F3"
% * S ... column vector of singular values of the extended matrix [B,A]
%     ! Note that it may need to satisfy restrictions on multiplicity of !
%     ! some singular values posed by the desired TLS class.             !
% * tol ... tolerance parameter used to determine the mutiplicity of singular values

%   OUTPUT parameters
% * A ... (m x n) real matrix; the model matrix
% * B ... (m x d) real matrix; the observation matrix
% * V ... ((n+d) x (n+d)) real orthogonal matrix, right singular space of
%     the extended matrix [B,A] satisfying conditions of the desired class
